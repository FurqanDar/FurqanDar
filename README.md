👋 Hi, I’m Furqan Dar

🚀 Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | Open-Source Developer

I build data-driven solutions that bridge scientific rigor and software engineering excellence. With a Ph.D. in Physics and 8+ years of computational experience, I specialize in designing scalable data pipelines, ML models, and open-source platforms that drive meaningful impact in healthcare, biomedical engineering, research, and beyond.

🔑 What I Do

📊 Data Science & ML – End-to-end workflows: data wrangling, statistical modeling, ML, and deployment

🏗️ Software Engineering – Architecting modular, maintainable, and open-source platforms

🧪 Scientific Computing – Proven track record in computational physics, biology, and medical imaging

🌍 Collaboration – Leading cross-functional projects that connect researchers, engineers, and clinicians

🛠️ Tech Toolbox

Data Science & ML: Python, pandas, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, lmfit
Data Engineering: SQL, modular pipelines, parallelization (sem), BIDS workflows
Visualization & Reporting: Jupyter, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Dashboards
Software & Cloud: Git, Linux, AWS (Certified Cloud Practitioner), C/C++, Mathematica
