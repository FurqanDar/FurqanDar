## Introduction

Hi, I’m Furqan Dar

Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | Open-Source Developer

I build data-driven solutions that bridge scientific rigor and software engineering excellence. With a Ph.D. in Physics and 8+ years of computational experience, I specialize in designing scalable data pipelines, ML models, and open-source platforms that drive meaningful impact in healthcare, biomedical engineering, research, and beyond.

## What I Do

Data Science & ML – End-to-end workflows: data wrangling, statistical modeling, ML, and deployment

Software Engineering – Architecting modular, maintainable, and open-source platforms

Scientific Computing – Proven track record in computational physics, biology, and medical imaging

Collaboration – Leading cross-functional projects that connect researchers, engineers, and clinicians

## Tech Toolbox

**Data Science & ML**: SQL, Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch/Keras, lmfit

**Visualization & Reporting**: Jupyter, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Dashboards, LaTeX

**Software & Cloud**: Git, Linux, AWS (Certified Cloud Practitioner), C/C++, Mathematica, HPC

## Featured Work

[Portfolio Repository](https://github.com/FurqanDar/DataScience-MachineLearning-Portfolio)
 – A curated collection of ML and data science projects (customer churn, real-time dashboards, predictive modeling, etc.).

[PETPAL](https://github.com/PETPAL-WUSM/PETPAL)
 – Comprehensive open-source PET/MRI image analysis suite, accelerating clinical research pipelines.

[LaSSI](https://github.com/Pappulab/LASSI)
